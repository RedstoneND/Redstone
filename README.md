# Build plugins

Run `make` to compile `addons/sourcemod/scripting/*.sp` files using latest stable build of SourceMod or `make build-dev` to compile using latest dev build.

# Deployment

If you have write access to this repo then following command will compile and
deploy all the files required by server to the `build` branch upstream:

```
export GH_TOKEN=<your token>; make build deploy
```

You won't likely need to do this manually though because Travis CI does
that automatically each time `master` branch changes.
